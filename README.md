# Dual

-[ ] Implement standard functions (sin, cos, signum, abs, pow, sqrt)
-[ ] Make generic Dual<T> { a: T, b: T }
-[ ] Add vector support

## I wonder
1. Is there any way to derive commutative operators?
1. How do I make sure d/dx x*y = y?
    * Explicitly tag
    * Generate random numbers
    * Have context maintaing counter?
