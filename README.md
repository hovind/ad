# Dual

- [ ] Implement standard functions (sin, cos, signum, abs, pow, sqrt)
- [x] Make generic Dual<T> { a: T, b: T }
- [x] Add vector support

## I wonder
1. Is there any way to derive commutative operators?
1. How do I make sure d/dx x*y = y?
    * Explicitly tag
    * Generate random numbers
    * Have context maintaing counter?
    * Or just use a vector ...
